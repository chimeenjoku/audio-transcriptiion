I decided to pass through the British Council Library and look up some journals on my way to my mechanic. Since I had a little more time on my hands, I drove into the library premises dedicate man and parked in a free space among other cars. I did not sit down in the library because I was just looking through the latest medical journals to see what articles will be of interest. I did not spend up to ten minutes in the library and decided to leave. It is difficult to describe the feeling I experienced in the car park that morning on a Saturday in March 1990. I instinctively walked to where I had parked my car just minutes earlier and another car was rudely there. I walked around just in case. I was not sure where I parked and my mother was nowhere to be found in the parking area. Confusion overtook me and it seemed as if it was a dream. Did I really come in my car? Did someone drop me? If someone did, then why do I have the keys in my hand? That was when the reality hit me that my car had been stolen.
